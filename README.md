# Abigail Jackson - Designory FED Assignment

## HTML
I generally try to keep my HTML as clean as possible, and do more of the styling and functions in the CSS or JS. I'm also learning more and more about accessibility, and used semantic `HTML5` tags for better organization and to make it easier to toggle through with `TAB`. All of the images have `alt` text; however, they are currently commented out since it would affect the look of the site as it. 

I also know the header is slightly different than the mock-up, but instead of recreating the logo in Illustrator or Photoshop or using a simple text field and styling it, I found the most recent Designory logo and used that .png instead. 

## SCSS/CSS
- Used partials to organize code into meaningful section
- Used Normalize.css for browser compatibility
- Created variables for colors and other reusable styles for consistency
- Styled global elements at the top and went sequentially by section, nesting for clarity and organization
- Buttons and navbar include user feedback, but are dead links at the moment
- Various media query breakpoints for accessibilty: Small Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile (L/M/S)
- Used `em`, `vh`, and `vw`measurements for the most part to make site adjustable in between breakpoints
- Used `vh`, and `vw`measurements specifically for adjusting elements to viewport size

## JS
- Functions only for navicon animation and to toggle `nav`
